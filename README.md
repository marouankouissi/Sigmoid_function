# Sigmoid_function
The use of Segmoid function to model dataset with Python

Sigmoid functions have become very popular in Machine Learning, especially in Deep learning, they are mainly used as activation functions in neural netyworks. They have S-shaped curves, expanded over a small interval [0,1], so they can be used to map a set of real numbers into values between 0 and 1, in order to interpret every element as a probability. Also, Sigmoid functions can be applied to fit a non-linear model to a dataset, which we try to do in this lab.
